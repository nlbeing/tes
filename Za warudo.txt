The World now has come, and change is at hand. Destiny's pulsing fragments awake and await commands.

My soul will rise to a new dimension. It's burning with possibility. Twenty-two disciples of light and dark have set the portal free.

Justice! Let the scales deal harsh equality.
Hanged man! Endure his foolish crucibles.
Death! Let love burn to its silent end.
Temperance! Reign over havoc, weal, and woe.
The devil! Fear the vortex swallowing all.
The tower! Tear it down with the wicked ones.

The star! Rend dark paths to distant wars.
The moon! Turn it on its head. Reality's a lie.
The sun! Worship the mercy that outshines sick truths.
Judgment! Sound the trumpets to the empire's end.

The world! Ah, how far away the ideal world! Ah, how far away the eternal world!

So, Karma weaves fate into a third world. I know the road is unforgiving. x2

He told me so, but I gave my word. Ah, how far away the ideal world! x2
